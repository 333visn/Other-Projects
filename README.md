This is a guide/brief summary to all the projects in the repository.

1. Brawl Stars Data Visualization
  This is a visualizer that uses RShiny in which the data is pulled from the Brawl Stars API (https://developer.brawlstars.com/#/). The application can display leaderboards for certain countries and brawlers, as well as personal statistics for certain brawlers. More information can be found in the about.Rmd in the Brawl Stars Data Visualization folder.

2. Quarterback Compliments Fantasy Football (2024)
   This is an program using Python and Excel that pulls data from FTN Fantasy and Draft Sharks and let's a user select an NFL Quarterback that they can draft in fantasy football and the program will display the other quarterbacks with the best matchups during the bye week of the quarterback selected. This is meant to give an idea as to who would be a good backup to draft given the quarterbacks on the board and the starter picked (and which starter to pick if the bye week landscape gives impacts the user's selection). Users can also remove quarterbacks off the board if they want, based on their preferences.
